# CartonExample

This project is an example of building an application using Swift React with [Carton](https://github.com/swiftwasm/carton).

> [!CAUTION]
> Unfortunately, the current version of Carton cannot build Swift React.
> Let's wait for Carton to support Swift 5.10.
> The following text is written assuming it has been supported.

## Building and Running

With the following command, the build and hosting will start, a browser will launch, and the application will run.

```sh
$ swift run carton dev
```
